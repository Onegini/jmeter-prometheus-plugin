# Contributing


* If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, addressing me (Jeff Ohrstrom) in the description of the pull request.
* If you plan to do something more involved, you should probably open an issue so we can talk about it. However you can also just create the pull request and the issue and we can discuss the concept in the issue and the implementation in the pull request.
* In terms of coding styles, I'm a native english speaker who just read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)(tm) so I tend to value readable code.  This library specifically tends towards basic Java standards and JMeter conventions.

* This is an open source project, so commits/pull request are welcome. Forks are awesome. Issues are abundant and highly desired.
